# HR-Data-Analysis-with-Microsoft-Power-BI
This project is an analysis of HR data using Microsoft Power BI. The data used is a fictional dataset that contains information about employee demographics, job history, salary, performance, and satisfaction.
## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to use Power BI to analyze the HR data and create an interactive dashboard that can be used to gain insights into the employee performance, satisfaction, and overall productivity. The specific objectives are as follows:

- Clean and transform the raw HR data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Create measures that capture key metrics such as employee turnover, average salary, and satisfaction level.
- Visualize the data using charts, graphs, and tables to identify patterns and trends.
- Develop a dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the HR data and allows users to filter the data based on various parameters.
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
The raw HR data contained some errors, inconsistencies, and missing values that needed to be addressed before analysis. The following steps were taken to clean and transform the data:

- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- Checked for missing values and filled them with appropriate values.
- Transformed categorical variables into numerical variables.
- Renamed columns for better readability.
## Creating Measures
The following measures were created to capture key HR metrics:

- **Employee turnover rate:** the percentage of employees who leave the company each year.
- **Average salary:** the average salary of employees in each department.
- **Satisfaction score:** a score that captures the overall satisfaction level of employees based on a survey.
## Data Visualization
The HR data was visualized using various charts, graphs, and tables. The following visualizations were created:

1. A bar chart showing the employee turnover rate by department.
2. A scatter plot showing the correlation between salary and performance.
3. A line chart showing the trend in satisfaction score over time.
4. A table showing the top 10 employees with the highest performance rating.
## Dashboard Creation
The final step in the project was to create a dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the HR data. The dashboard contains the following elements:

- A filter that allows users to select the department they want to view.
- A bar chart showing the employee turnover rate by department.
- A scatter plot showing the correlation between salary and performance.
- A line chart showing the trend in satisfaction score over time.
- A table showing the top 10 employees with the highest performance rating.
- The dashboard is interactive, and users can filter the data based on various parameters. The dashboard provides a quick and easy way to gain insights into the HR data and identify trends and patterns.

## Conclusion
The HR data analysis project using Microsoft Power BI has provided valuable insights into the employee performance, satisfaction, and overall productivity. The cleaned and transformed data, created measures, visualizations, and dashboard have made it easier to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions. The dashboard provides an easy-to-use tool that can be used by HR managers to make informed decisions and improve the overall performance of the company.
